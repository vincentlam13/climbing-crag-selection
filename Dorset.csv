"Lean Machine Wall  Rockfax DescriptionThe furthest west area of the Boulder Ruckle is a very secluded section of the cliff, and its base is quickly cut-off from easy exit options. Most of the climbs are steep and pumpy experiences, though the gear is usually good. Approach - Walk 50m (17 fence posts) beyond the 4th wall encountered on the coast path when walking west from the lighthouse, then climb over the fence and head down through a break in the bushes to the cliff edge. 5m to the right are 2 stakes directly above The Lean Machine. Make a free-hanging abseil to boulders. Access to the boulder beach is only possible if the sea is calm. Tides - Climbing on this wall is not advisable in rough seas, although the approach described above is possible at high tide during calm seas.

"Ocean Boulevard Wall  Rockfax DescriptionA fine, leaning wall composed of mostly excellent rock that is home to a number of Swanage's finest single pitch extremes. The routes are sustained and although generally well protected, are very pumpy. The wall is a little featureless save for some thin crack-lines and the odd peg and thread. This makes route finding slightly problematical although the major lines of Ocean Boulevard, Mother Africa and Wall of the Worlds are easily identified. Tides - The boulder beach at the base of the cliff is above high tide. Approach - Follow the coast path to the 4th stone wall, when walking west from the lighthouse. The abseil stakes are hidden above an earthy ramp 15m back towards the lighthouse from this stile. The abseil takes you down the upper part of The Ramp. Note - The abseil/belay stakes in the gully below the stone wall itself are directly above the route Ocean Boulevard and are often used as an alternative approach.","Ocean Boulevard Wall  Rockfax DescriptionA fine, leaning wall composed of mostly excellent rock that is home to a number of Swanage's finest single pitch extremes.

"Amphitheatre Ledge  Rockfax DescriptionAmphitheatre Ledge is a quiet and secluded area that deserves more traffic. The climbing is invariably steep with good rock, but the finishes require caution and sometimes need a pre-placed belay rope. Some of the routes are awkward to approach. Tides - The area is generally non-tidal, although some of the starts are much easier to reach at low tide. Keep away in rough conditions. Approach (routes 1 to 5, and 10) - Abseil from two stakes above The Amphitheatre on its east side (left - looking out). The abseil ends on a ledge system that leads along the base of the cliff. Approach (routes 6 to 9) - Abseil from a stake, below a thorn bush, to the left of a hollow (looking out). This is 30m left of the Amphitheatre. Leave the abseil rope in place as a belay point at the top of the routes. Take prusik loops down in case of problems. Routes 6 and 7 can be reached by a sea-level traverse at low tide (Diff).","Amphitheatre Ledge  Rockfax DescriptionAmphitheatre Ledge is a quiet and secluded area that deserves more traffic.

Manhattan Skyline Area  Rockfax DescriptionThis excellent area is easy to reach and has some great rock. Sadly the central section fell down in the winter of 2000/01. It contained several routes including the classic Grip '89. The continuation wall running right from the rock scar has a number of strong lines on good rock. The area has suffered the loss of one route due to rockfall. Tides - The base of the routes are covered at high tide.

"Graveyard Area  Rockfax DescriptionHidden away under the west end of the quarry are two very eerie caves containing layers of tiered roofs. The rock is good with dramatic mega-steep pump-outs which are far more rewarding than the average clip-up in the quarry above, if you are up to them. This is also a great swimming and jumping spot for the hot summer days. Some of the routes here have been soloed, however most can not be considered as deep water solos.","Graveyard Area  Rockfax DescriptionHidden away under the west end of the quarry are two very eerie caves containing layers of tiered roofs.

"West Face  Rockfax DescriptionThis is one of the most impressive sections of cliff at Swanage, and also one of the most intimidating. The cliff's well-respected sheer white face and adjoining sea cave have an array of hard multi-pitch climbs that weave their way up and around its well-featured bulk. The rock is generally good, although the finishes need care. The first section of Guillemot West close to the base of the abseil approach, rises dramatically to the summit of Valkyrie Buttress. There is a number of relatively popular routes and some harder ones - all have their fair share of poor rock and unstable finishes. Tides - The boulder beach below the face is non-tidal, but calm seas are needed to get to the face from below the abseil point. Approach - From the abseil, boulder-hop rightwards (looking out) around the large Valkyire Buttress for 100m to below the towering white face and the brooding sea cave. a Restriction - No climbing from 1st March to 31st July due to nesting birds.","West Face  Rockfax DescriptionThis is one of the most impressive sections of cliff at Swanage, and also one of the most intimidating.

"East Face  Rockfax DescriptionThis is a justifiably popular section of cliff. With its easy access, good lower to mid-grade routes and clean-cut quarried finishes, it is a perfect place to sample the delights that Swanage has to offer. The routes are a bit shorter than on the neighbouring West Face, and many have a friendly feel to them. Tides - All the climbs are non-tidal and are possible even during moderately rough seas because of the shelter afforded by the boulders along the base. Approach - The Tensor II Area is situated to the left of the approach abseil (looking out), and the routes are reached along the boulders below the wall.","East Face  Rockfax DescriptionThis is a justifiably popular section of cliff.

"Smokey Hole  Rockfax DescriptionA huge leaning wall of good rock with routes to match those on the Lean Machine face. It is hidden from view except for a sideways glimpse from Cliff-Top Quarry. This little quarry is the gearing-up point. There are also a few routes in the small quarry above the wall known as Topmast Quarry. Approach - The Cliff-Top Quarry is situated 50m further on from Topmast Quarry, which in turn is 300m west from Dancing Ledge. The descent path is below some planks on the coast path that cross a dry stream bed. The four routes are gained by an abseil from a point 10m left (looking out) of the descent to the Cliff-Top Quarry. The abseil leads down Diving for Pearls to a solid bolt-belay just above the high water line (backed up by the abseil rope). It maybe necessary to swing-in on the abseil or place nuts on the way down to stay in contact with the rock. All four climbs can be gained from this belay. Tides - The belay bolt is above the high tide mark but keep away in rough seas.","Smokey Hole  Rockfax DescriptionA huge leaning wall of good rock with routes to match those on the Lean Machine face.

"So Hardcore Area  Rockfax DescriptionBefore the main cliffs start at Wallsend, there are a couple of isolated walls. Although very limited in height, the climbs are on good compact rock and offer very fingery and technical climbing. The small buttresses are sheltered and dry very quickly. Approach - Drive through Weston and, at a roundabout, turn right into Reap Lane and park after the first traffic-calming installation. From here go past the second traffic-calming installation, and pick up a footpath/track on the right (opposite Rip Croft) that heads towards the huge Southwell Business Park complex. At the massive fence, turn right and follow it to the coast path. From the coast path, drop down a path that cuts back right and then left to the small walls. Two of the routes are on a short flowstone-wall below the main walls and are approached via a steep slope below the route So Hardcore.","So Hardcore Area  Rockfax DescriptionBefore the main cliffs start at Wallsend, there are a couple of isolated walls.

Approach - Drive to Portland Bill and park in the car park (fee). Walk back up the road past the Pulpit Inn and head out leftwards up a minor road towards the Coastwatch Lookout. Just before the Coastwatch Lookout, go down a grass slope to the cliff edge (see map on page 166) then descend a steep and precarious path (rope sometimes in place) onto a promontory and then continue down right to below Coastguard North. Walk north under this, past a gully, to reach Wallsend South. The wall is about mid-way along Wallsend Cove, so it can also be approached from either the north.","The Bigger Piece Area  Rockfax DescriptionAn eye-catching, towering buttress, which is home to some exhilarating and exposed climbs that are well worth the long approach via the boulder beach.

"Hong Kong Phooey Area  Rockfax DescriptionAn extensive section of cliff that has a number of good climbs on its various buttresses and walls. Good conditions are usually found late in the day on the shadier sections of the cliff. Tides - The ledges below the left-hand section of the area are sea-washed at high tide and in rough seas. Approach - Drive to Portland Bill and park in the car park (fee). Walk back up the road past the Pulpit Inn and head out leftwards up a minor road towards the Coastwatch Lookout. Just before the Coastwatch Lookout, go down a grass slope to the cliff edge (see map on page 166) then descend a steep and precarious path (rope sometimes in place) onto a promontory and then continue down right to below Coastguard North. Walk north under this, past a gully, to reach Wallsend South. If the tide is high a slightly longer approach can be made from the northern end of Wallsend.","Hong Kong Phooey Area  Rockfax DescriptionAn extensive section of cliff that has a number of good climbs on its various buttresses and walls.
